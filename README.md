## Overview

This is a React ToDo List app. Unlike my other ToDo list app, I'm not following any tutorial this time. Just figuring it out from my notes and documentation.

## Sticking Points & What I learned

React Components & Passing Props

- Having done this project using seperate components for everything, I gained a far better understanding of passing props from parent to child components. And feel I have a good understanding of the logic behind doing this now.

UseState

- This is still new and very interesting to me. So I'm still getting used to writing the logic for state setters. But feeling like the more I do it the quicker it is coming to me.
